    * [DXC Triage](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/891)

      * If an issue is screened to
        [Dormant](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/milestone/11),
        we are not going to be actively working on fixing it. If a Dormant issue
        is important to you please explain in the issue why it is important!
  * [LLVM/Clang](https://github.com/orgs/llvm/projects/4)
    * A lot of work has gone into filing issues and organizing work.
    * This should all be public in the next month or so.

    proposals.
