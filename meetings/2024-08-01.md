    * [DXC Triage](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/891)

      * If an issue is screened to
        [Dormant](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/milestone/11),
        we are not going to be actively working on fixing it. If a Dormant issue
        is important to you please explain in the issue why it is important!
  * [LLVM/Clang](https://github.com/orgs/llvm/projects/4)
    * A lot of work has gone into filing issues and organizing work.
    * This should all be public in the next month or so.
    * Look! [Cool graphs!](https://github.com/orgs/llvm/projects/4/insights?period=3M)

* [Clang implementation proposals](https://github.com/llvm/wg-hlsl/tree/main/proposals)
  * In future meetings we may use time to dig into the details of these
    proposals.
