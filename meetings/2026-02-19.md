* Discussion topics
  * @bogner gave an update on element-aligned vectors. The conversation on discourse is progressing though there are some concerns being brought up that @bogner will follow up on addressing. ([proposal](https://github.com/llvm/wg-hlsl/blob/main/proposals/0039-element-aligned-vectors.md), [discourse](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-add-a-data-layout-specifier-for-element-aligned-vectors/89764))
  * @bogner brought attention to an issue with the SPIR-V backend's `reconstitutePeeledArrayType`. @s-perron is going to take a look. (llvm/llvm-project#180600)
  * @s-perron has added a way to specify textures with multiple MIP levels in the offload-test-suite and implemented the appropriate logic for Vulkan. Someone from the DirectX side of things will need to take a look at implementing this there.
