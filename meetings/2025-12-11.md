title: 2025-12-11 - HLSL Working Group Minutes
---

* Discussion topics
  * @farzonl gave an overview of the implementation proposal for Matrix Element
    Expression, https://github.com/llvm/wg-hlsl/pull/357. There was general
    agreement that this approach seems reasonable.
  * We discussed @farzonl's PR to handle GEPs to vector elements in
    SPIRVEmitIntrinsics in llvm/project#171682. We noted that we deliberately
    omitted handling this case originally, but that this does seem like the
    right place to handle this for now.
