* Discussion topics
  * We had a brief discussion of restrictions on the ternary operator and select intrinsic that are implemented by DXC. We shelved this conversation since it is more appropriate for the language design audience. We will follow up there with a concrete proposal on [hlsl-specs](https://github.com/microsoft/hlsl-specs).
  * [Feature Profiles](https://gist.github.com/llvm-beanz/07094cdc9ef49e4897d38474eef4ef92)
    * Tex raised concerns about conflating profiles and feature tiers, suggesting that feature tiers should be separate from target profiles and specified indipendently.
      * Chris: The proposal as written describes profiles as a base target and required feature set, but provides options to override the base values. This should cover the full use cases.
      * It was difficult to reach consensus without a fleshed out proposal to review.
    * Nathan suggested allowing for user-defined profiles as well as compiler-provided profiles.
    * Action Item: Chris to flesh out and post the proposal to [wg-hlsl](https://github.com/llvm/wg-hlsl/).
  * CBuffer Update
    * Justin put up a draft PR, hopefully this unblocks - https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/156919.
  * Status of semantics
    * Action Item: Chris to review https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/152537
  * Request for feedback on RFC: https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-adding-instructions-to-to-carry-gep-type-traversal-information/88141
