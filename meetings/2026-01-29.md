* Discussion topics
  * @farzonl brought up the SPIR-V assertions for vectors that need to be
    broken up in [llvm-project#177837]. @s-perron pointed out that this is a
    case that isn't implemented yet and should be relatively self-contained to
    fix.
  * We discussed some issues around dead constants and cbuffer padding that
    trip up spirv-cross. These are both known issues that are on the radar but
    will take some engineering effort to fix.
