* Proposal: [0022 - Resource Instance Analysis](0022-resource-instance-analysis.md)
* Author(s): [Ashley Coleman](https://github.com/V-FEXrt)
* Status: **Accepted**

## Introduction

This proposal introduces a new term, Resource Instance, which represents a 
unique and specific resource. The instance is referenced via a handle returned
from the create handle intrinsics and it is possible to have multiple handles
pointing at a specific Resource Instance, but each unique instance is
disambiguated by the handle creation parameters.

Beyond creation parameters, Resource Instances have several derived properties.
Type, CounterDirection (HasCounter), and GloballyCoherent are identified
examples. Type is currently handled well so this proposal suggests no changes.
However CounterDirection and GloballyCoherent require careful late stage
analysis to derive the correct property values.

To serve the needs of CounterDirection and to setup a framework for future
instance properties this document proposes that instance analysis be combined
into the `DXILResourceBindingAnalysis` pass and that the pass be renamed.


## Proposed solution

In order to support the generic resource instance analysis `DXILResourceBindingAnalysis` 
and `ResourceBindingInfo` will be renamed to `DXILResourceAnalysis` and `ResourceInfo`
respectively. Then instance properties will be resolved during the
`DXILResourceAnalysis` pass.


The following mechanical changes are required to align existing and inflight code
to the new structure.

- `CounterDirection` will supercede `HasCounter` which will be removed from `ResourceTypeInfo`
- `CounterDirection` and `GloballyCoherent` will be added to `ResourceInfo`
- `DXILResourceAnalysis` will have a new step to resolve the instance's counter direction.

Certain generated DXIL can create an illegal state for an instance's properties
such as an instance with both an incremented and decremented counter. When this
occurs the analysis pass should prioritize performance for the common case and
defer detailed error message calculation for the uncommon failure code path.

To achieve that goal, a step in `DXILResourceAnalysis` may set a terminal or
invalid value in the `ResourceInfo` that a later pass `DXILPostOptimizationValidationPass`
(newly introduced by this proposal) will detect and do more expensive processing
to raise useful Diagnostics.

It's important to note that in general Diagnostics should not be raised in
LLVM analyses or passes. Analyses may be invalidated and re-ran several times
increasing performance impact and raising repeated diagnostics. Diagnostics
raised after transformations passes also lose source context resulting in less
useful error messages. However the shader compiler requires certain validations
to be done after code optimizations which requires the Diagnostic to be raised
from a pass. Impact is minimized by raising the Diagnostic only in one pass and
minimizing computation in the common case.

## Alternatives considered

The majority of the core feature work was implemented in [this PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/130356)
which proposed the following solution.

- Introduce a new pass and analysis map for each new piece of data associated with a ResourceBinding
- Emit error Diagnostics live if an invalid state arose
- (Not yet implemented) Backfill `HasCounter` on `TypeInfo` during a later pass

This solution was costly in both perforamance and architecture. It was also
misaligned with other pass infrastructure. Over several round of reviews the PR
require significant changes which ultimately highlighted the underlying issues.

Once coined and reframed as a "Resource Instance Problem", the best solution was clear.
