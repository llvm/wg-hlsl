## Introduction

HLSL resources need to go through a few different representations throughout
the compilation flow. This proposal tries to describe the various places where
we will need to represent these and codify how we will go about representing
the resources in those places.

## Motivation

The life cycle of a resource needs to flow from a high level representation
that represents what the user wrote in HLSL source until it eventually is
emitted as DXIL by the DirectX backend in LLVM. We would like to design the set
of intermediate representations such that we can get good diagnostics, good
optimization, and we aren't likely to have to redesign the representation in
the short term. We also need to be mindful of how this will interact with the
SPIR-V backend.

## Proposed solution

At the HLSL level we want to lean on the existing infrastructure in clang as
much as possible, and avoid deviating from the norms unless there's a good
reason. This is different from how resources are handled at the HLSL level in
DXC. On the other end, when we're emitting DXIL we want it to be as compatible
as possible with existing drivers. This means that the DXIL representation
itself needs to be considered more or less fixed.

In LLVM IR we choose to represent resources using the ``TargetExtType``
infrastructure which was largely motivated by the need for target specific
opaque types like those used in SPIR-V code generation. In designing operations
on these types we take motivation from the DXIL representations, but since
we're not locked in to a stable format we're free to simplify and generalize
where it makes sense to do so.

### Clang ASTs

In the clang ASTs we'd rather avoid custom handling of DXIL resource types as
much as possible, and we're motivated by the idea of implementing whatever we
can as-if it was a library implementation of HLSL.

There are two major aspects to how we represent resources in clang:

1. We leverage the internal ``hlsl.h`` where possible and generate ASTs in
   HLSLExternalSemaSource where the expressivity of HLSL isn't sufficient for
   library solutions.
2. We introduce an HLSL specific type, ``__hlsl_resource_t``, to represent
   resource handles, and encode properties about the kind of handle in
   attributes on this type.

In order to represent the attributes we need, we need to introduce a variant of
clang's ``AttributedType``, which we'll call ``HLSLAttributedResourceType``.
This type will keep track of the ``__hlsl_resource_t`` and the hlsl-specific
attributes thereon.

That is to say, at the AST level a resource type like ``StructuredBuffer``
should mostly just look like an arbitrary class. This class will contain a
"Handle" member of an ``HLSLAttributedResourceType`` type, and its methods will
mostly be implemented by calling builtins that operate on this handle.

### LLVM IR targeting DirectX

Resources in LLVM IR will be represented using ``TargetExtType``, which allows
us to create mostly opaque types, but they can have a target specific name,
list of types, and list of integer parameters. This lets us define something
like ``target("dx.TypedBuffer", <4 x float>, isWriteable, isROV)`` for a buffer
containing 4 floats and holding information on whether it's writeable and/or an
ROV.

From here, there are two things to design:

1. The set of target types we need.
2. The set of operations on those target types.

Details on these types and operations are documented in [DXILResources.html],
which will be updated as we handle more types and operations.

### LLVM IR targeting SPIR-V

Clang currently generates ``target("spirv.Image", ...)`` types when generating
code for OpenCL targetting SPIR-V. It's likely that we'll need to do some work
to handle all of the HLSL resources, but it looks likely that we can leverage
that existing infrastructure for SPIR-V.

There is no detailed plan for this yet, but the implementation experience
targetting DXIL and the existing patterns in the SPIR-V backend should put us
in a good place when we take on that work.

### DXIL

The DXIL representation that we lower to needs to be compatible with the DXIL
that DXC emits and existing drivers.

The representation we're going for is partially documented in [DXIL.rst], but
note that there are shortcomings to that document that make it somewhat
unreliable:

1. Some of the features described were future directions at the time of writing
   that don't exactly map to what we have today, such as the non-legacy
   ``cbufferLoad`` and ``GetBufferBasePtr``
2. Many features, especially from SM6.6 and above, are not documented there at
   all.

We'll need to validate what we're doing against the existing implementation in
DXC and by leveraging the DXIL validator.
